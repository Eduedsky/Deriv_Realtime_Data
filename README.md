# GitHub Repository Updater Service

## Project Overview

The GitHub Repository Updater Service is designed to automate the process of pushing updated log files from a local server to a GitHub repository. This service is particularly useful for maintaining up-to-date backups of log files and ensuring that real-time data is accessible and stored securely in a version-controlled environment.

## Features

- **Automatic File Detection**: Automatically detects new or modified log files based on predefined patterns.
- **Continuous Integration**: Pushes updates to GitHub every minute, ensuring that the repository is always up-to-date.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to manage and log file access issues, network problems, or Git-related errors.
- **Security**: Utilizes SSH for secure communication with GitHub, ensuring that all data transfers are encrypted.

## Prerequisites

Before you deploy the GitHub Repository Updater Service, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Git installed on your local machine
- A GitHub account
- SSH keys set up for secure communication with GitHub
